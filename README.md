## 📘 Overview
This repository showcases my journey in **Deep Learning** through various projects and study notes. Each project demonstrates the application of neural networks and deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems. From foundational concepts to advanced models, this repository covers a wide spectrum of topics.

## 📂 Projects

**📚 00 - Learning DL**: This folder contains the basic notebooks I prepared while learning DL (Deep Learning).

**💳 01 - Credit Score Classification Project**: This project focuses on classifying credit scores into three categories (Good, Standard, Poor) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. It involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, model optimization with techniques like early stopping and dropout, and evaluation based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
